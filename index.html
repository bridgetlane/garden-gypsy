<h2>Garden Gypsy</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Attempt to keep all of your flowers happy to grow your garden.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The game should be frustrating.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Casual games.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Hit 'w' to shift water placement and hit 's' to shift sun placement according to your flower's needs.
<br>System dynamics: Water only shifts to the right and sun will always hit half of the flowers.
<br>Core mechanic: You can press 'w' and 's' to shift the placement of water or sun.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This prototype explores the artist play style, something I had not done yet.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Features:</strong>
My game is unique because it restricts movement.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are a gypsy tending to your garden.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Story:</strong>
There is no story.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Casual gamers.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
3 minutes.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
You have to distribute the water and sun to keep the score up for each flower. Not every flower will be satisfied, but you have to give them enough of what they need to keep them alive.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All art assets were made by me.
